# Simple-Scuttle #

This was inspired by [Dominic Tarr's scuttlebut
module](https://npmjs.org/package/scuttlebutt), which, though totally awesome,
I found a little hard to parse. So in order to understand [the
paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/flowgossip.pdf), I wrote my
own.

The goal has been fidelity to the paper. This is still in alpha-- API changes
are coming, soon. Hence the lack of documentation. I did however, try to write
in a very readable style.
